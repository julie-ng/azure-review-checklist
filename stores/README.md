# Stores

This app uses [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/), which is a store used to share application state across pages and components.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This page is a work in progress.

## `ChecklistStore`

- read-only
- keeps track of raw JSON from source data repo
- holds our app data schema

## `ReviewStore`

Keep track of user state as they are filling out reviews.

### Schema

Brainstormingâ€¦

- `reviews[]` - Array containing all reviews
  
#### Review

- ID (generate own)
- Checklist Key, e.g. `alz` and incl. date? (JSON updates)
- Create date
- Last saved date
- Items


#### Item
- GUID
- Checked or Unchecked?
- Reason, e.g. "Fulfilled", "Not Required", etc. (should this be reasonID?)
- Notes
